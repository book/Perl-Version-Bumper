Revision history for Perl-Version-Bumper

{{$NEXT}}

0.181 2024-12-27 BOOK
    - default to the latest stable when running under a dev release of perl
    - fix some tests that were failing with perl versions below v5.20
    - load version.pm explicitely, to compile with perl5.10.0

0.175 2024-12-23 BOOK
    - properly preserve indentation when replacing a `use VERSION`
    - put the `use VERSION` line as the first statement of the
      file, before the `package` line (starting with version
      1.154, Perl::Critic won't count this as a violation of
      Perl::Critic::Policy::Modules::RequireExplicitPackage)
    - add support for several compatibility modules

0.162 2024-12-07 BOOK
    - add a CLI tool for bumping files: perl-version-bump

0.157 2024-11-20 BOOK
    - First release, based on software originally developed at Booking.com.
    - This version contains over 100 extra commits on top of the
      Booking.com code. They add a lot of unit tests, store the feature
      data in static table (instead of recomputing it using the running
      perl), which makes it possible to bump code to any Perl version
      using any version of the perl binary. (In other words, it's possible
      to bump v5.14 code to v5.20 using `perl5.12`.)
    - This version number is basically the number of commits that lead
      to this first release (if CVS could do it, there's no reason I
      can't do it either). I want to get to 1.000 soon, and need to stop
      perfecting this before doing the initial release. ðŸ˜…
