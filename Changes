Revision history for Perl-Version-Bumper

{{$NEXT}}
    - First release, based on software originally developed at Booking.com.
    - This version contains over 100 extra commits on top of the
      Booking.com code. They add a lot of unit tests, store the feature
      data in static table (instead of recomputing it using the running
      perl), which makes it possible to bump code to any Perl version
      using any version of the perl binary. (Meaning that it's possible
      to bump v5.14 code to v5.20 using `perl5.12`.)
